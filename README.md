# meetmecafe
MeetMeCafe is a web application created within the Udacity Senior WeB Developer nanodegree programm, and it is planed to be developed as a complete and public available project in the nearest future.

Limitation and issues that will be fixed in the next versions of the application:
- currently no user cabinet is available for editing user info
- emails are not sent yet
- meetings are shown for today; currently there is no possibility to choose the date for the meetings show
- all meetings are listed from through out the world, not the nearest ones; and no possibility to limit the area of meetings to be shown
- invited friends are currently limited to 5
- there is no notification about the overlapping meetings
- users can't accept or decline invitation to private meetings
- created by you and invited y others private meetings aren't separated
- list of meetings aren't linked directly to the map makers
- meetings are not clustered yet
- javascript code and CSS needs some refactoring
